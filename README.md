Working with JTables and MySQL in Java
======================================

This application is a basic MySQL CRUD application using JTables and other graphical components in the Swing toolkit in Java. 

The application connects to a MySQL database that holds customer information. The information that it holds is as follows:
- ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- City
- State
- Date Registered

The user will be able to run the application and navigate the items in the database using the JTable. This will include sorting, adding items, updating individual information in each row, and removing items.

More functionality will be added as I progress.
