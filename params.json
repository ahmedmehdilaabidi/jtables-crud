","body":"Working with JTables and MySQL in Java\r\n======================================\r\n\r\nThis application is a basic MySQL CRUD application using JTables and other graphical components in the Swing toolkit in Java. The user will be able to run the application and navigate the items in the database using the JTable. This will include sorting, adding items, updating individual information in each row, and removing items.\r\n\r\nYou can view the documentation for this application [here][documentation].\r\n\r\nThe Application\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe application contains a JTable that is used to display the data from the database. This is auto-sortable, and the interface contains text fields for insertion, as well as an error reporting area at the top. Below is a screenshot of the application.\r\n\r\n![alt text][layout]\r\n\r\n### Adding an Entry\r\n\r\nYou are able to add an entry by using the combination of JTextFields and JButtons at the bottom row of the application. Data must be entered properly or an error will be displayed. States are added using exactly two letters, while dates are added in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD.\r\n\r\n![alt text][adding]\r\n\r\n### Removing an Entry\r\n\r\nRemoving an entry is as simple as selecting an entry from the table and clicking the Remove Customer button.\r\n\r\n### Editing an Entry\r\n\r\nTo edit an entry in the database, first select any entry in the table by clicking on the entry, then right click the cell in that entry that you'd like to edit. After doing so, a JOptionPane will appear with the option for you to enter the new value for that cell.\r\n\r\n![alt text][editing]\r\n\r\nThe Database\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe application connects to a MySQL database that holds customer information. The information that it holds is as follows:\r\n- ID\r\n- First Name\r\n- Last Name\r\n- Phone Number\r\n- Email Address\r\n- City\r\n- State\r\n- Date Registered\r\n\r\nYou can create and populate the database with sample data by importing the customer.sql file included in the repository, or you can create this database on your own with the following MySQL:\r\n```SQL\r\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS `customer`;\r\nCREATE TABLE `customer` (\r\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n  `first_name` varchar(30) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\r\n  `last_name` varchar(50) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\r\n  `phone_number` varchar(15) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\r\n  `email_address` varchar(255) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\r\n  `city` varchar(80) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\r\n  `state` varchar(2) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\r\n  `date_registered` date NOT NULL,\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=4 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo import the sql file, run the following from your command line.\r\n```\r\nmysql -u YOURUSERNAME -p YOURDATABASENAME < customer.sql\r\n```\r\nMore functionality will be added as I progress.\r\n\r\n[documentation]: https://github.com/caseyscarborough/jtables-crud/raw/master/doc/index.html\r\n[layout]: https://github.com/caseyscarborough/jtables-crud/raw/master/img/1.png \"The application's basic layout.\"\r\n[adding]: https://github.com/caseyscarborough/jtables-crud/raw/master/img/2.png \"Recommended format for adding data.\"\r\n[editing]: https://github.com/caseyscarborough/jtables-crud/raw/master/img/3.png \"JOptionPane for data editing.\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
